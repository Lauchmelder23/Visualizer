# Visualizer

Hopefully eventually a neat little realtime 3D audio visualizer.

DSP is hard.

## How to build
After cloning, perform the following commands
```
git submodule update --init --recursive

mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
```

Finally, to build the project do the following

## Linux
Run `make`

## Windows
CMake generated project files in the `build` directory which you can open in an IDE and build there.
